# Prediction with Amazaon Alexa Reviews

## By Elena Korshakova and Diedre Brown

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project aims to analyze these reviews and ratings of Amazon Alexa devices from 2017 (as training data) and 2018 (as testing data) to develop an algorithm to predict star ratings based on user reviews. Through the process, we aim to determine if star ratings and an end-to-end sentiment analysis of user review comments from 2017 we can predict with accuracy, the star ratings of 2018. If successful, our findings have the potential to provide tech companies with a summary of user preferences and top criteria for the development of future products, as well as, assist in predicting user reactions to recently implemented features based on data collected from previous reviews of similar features.
